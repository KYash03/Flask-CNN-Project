# CNN-Based Pneumonia Detection Web App

## Overview

This project is a Python-based web application for detecting pneumonia from X-ray images. Key technologies include Flask, Keras, and PyTest. The app achieves a 92% validation accuracy and is hosted on Google Cloud Platform's App Engine.

## Features

- **Pneumonia Detection**: Detects pneumonia in X-ray images.
- **Flask Web App**: User-friendly interface built with Flask.
- **PyTest Testing**: Rigorously tested for reliability.
- **GCP App Engine**: Deployed on Google Cloud Platform.

## How It Works

1. Upload an X-ray image.
2. The app's custom CNN model analyzes the image.
3. Get a diagnosis: presence or absence of pneumonia.
